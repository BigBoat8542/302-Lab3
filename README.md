Summarize what your script does or the problem you were trying to solve.
Summarize any major errors you encountered and what sources they used to resolve the errors.
How you fixed the errors, or where the error is if you couldn't figure something out.

This script is taking data from the national weather website evaluating Philadelphia, PA(my hometown) to see what current temperature and weather conditions exist in the city. Trying to solve the ability to take a location's lat and long to display and update weather conditions
I encountered no major errors except when I added my testing and was concatenating but forgot to convert to text at first, outside of that it felt very straight forward
To be honest this was a pretty straight foward assignment for me, I didn't have many errors and I used my intuition to resolve the ones I did have. The assignment instructions were another resource I used that was helpful and useful as well.
